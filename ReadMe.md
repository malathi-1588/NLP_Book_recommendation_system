# Personalized Book Recommendation System
### Overview

The Personalized Book Recommendation System is a Python-based project aimed at providing users with tailored book recommendations based on their preferences and interests. The system employs two distinct methods: TF-IDF analysis and keyword-based preference matching using FastText embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates an extractive summarization feature to provide concise summaries of recommended books.
Features
    **TF-IDF Based Recommendation**: Utilizes TF-IDF analysis to recommend similar books based on textual similarities such as themes and writing styles.
    **Keyword-Based Preference Matching**: Engages users in a questionnaire to understand their preferences, extracts keywords using KeyBERT, and matches user preferences with book descriptions using FastText embeddings for personalized recommendations.
    **Extractive Summarization**: Incorporates an extractive summarization feature using K-means clustering to provide concise summaries of recommended books.
    **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, allowing users to input book titles and answer preference questions effortlessly.

### Usage
    1) Input a book title to receive recommendations using the TF-IDF based method.
    2) Answer preference questions to receive personalized recommendations based on keyword matching.
    3) Explore recommended books and view summaries using the extractive summarization feature.
